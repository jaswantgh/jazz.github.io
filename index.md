My name is Jazz. I’m currently an undergraduate student at [Curtin University](/https://www.curtin.edu.au/), pursuing a double major in [Electrical, Electronic Engineering and Data Science](/https://www.curtin.edu.au/study/offering/course-ug-electrical-and-electronic-engineering-honours-and-data-science-double-degree-major-beng-honsbsc--mddu-eleds///). 

My studies have sparked my interest in the aerospace 🚀 and healthcare 🏥 industries.

Ultimately, I am searching for ways to positvely imapct the world.

At the moment I work casually as a research assistant at the [Intelligent Sensing & Perception Laboratory](/https://ispl-research.com/) at the New Technologies at Curtin Bentley and as an intern with [CalcTree](/https://www.calctree.com/).

Last semester, I took Electronic Fundamentals, Electromagnetic and electromechanical energy conversion, Signals & Systems and Non parametric and regression in second semester as a second year student. 

For those who share similar interests, there are resources available for free! You can explore my articles, check out educational mini-bootcamps on my YouTube channel, or receive updates through my [Newsletter](/menu3/). 

Additionally, I have a passion for Badminton and have recently started a dedicated business called Power Smashers in Perth, WA. 😊
