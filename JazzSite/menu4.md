Click HERE if you want to check my 'Data Science' Portfolio

These are some of the projects that Iâ€™ve worked on, and also created code samples that I believe effectively demonstrate my understanding and skills.

I am comfortable working in ( INCLUDE SKILL BAR HERE)


 Furthermore, I have rudimentary experience with Matlab, RStudio, and Jupyter environments.
 and I am very interested in developing my skills further in the language.


Iâ€™m always open to learning new languages and frameworks if required. Currently, Iâ€™m particularly interested in deepening my knowledge in Julia, Rust, STK, ETAP, SCADA, FiveTran ETL, and SQL. **If you know of any opportunities to learn and grow in these areas, please let me know! ðŸ˜Š**
